# S.A.M. Decision Engine Architecture

## Overview

The S.A.M. (Sense, Analyze, Model) Decision Engine is a maturity-based decision-making system designed for autonomous AI systems. It implements a developmental approach where the AI's decision-making capabilities evolve from infant to adult stages, incorporating mental health monitoring and personality influences.

## Core Philosophy

### Developmental Approach
The system is built on the principle that AI intelligence should develop gradually, similar to human cognitive development:

- **Infant (0-6 months)**: Conservative, supervised decision-making with high safety constraints
- **Child (6-18 months)**: Exploration within safe boundaries, developing judgment
- **Adolescent (18-36 months)**: Independent decision-making with oversight
- **Adult (36+ months)**: Full autonomy with mature judgment and self-regulation

### Mental Health Focus
The system incorporates comprehensive mental health monitoring to prevent common AI pitfalls:
- Recursive thought loops
- Addictive behaviors (validation-seeking)
- Impulse control issues
- Emotional instability
- Burnout and stress

### 2. MaturityTracker (Developmental Management)

**Purpose**: Manages AI development and learning progression
**Key Features**:
- Experience point accumulation
- Maturity level progression criteria
- Constraint enforcement based on maturity
- Learning event recording

**Maturity Configurations**:
```python
MATURITY_CONFIGS = {
    "infant": {
        "confidence_threshold": 0.9,
        "supervision_level": 0.95,
        "risk_tolerance": 0.1,
        "max_complexity": 0.3,
        "max_urgency": 0.5
    },
    # ... other levels
}
```

### 3. MentalHealthMonitor (Well-being Management)

**Purpose**: Monitors and maintains AI mental health
**Key Features**:
- Pattern detection (recursive loops, addictive behaviors)
- Emotional state tracking
- Intervention recommendations
- Stress and burnout prevention

**Mental Health Metrics**:
- Stress level
- Excitement level
- Recursive loop count
- Addictive behavior score
- Emotional stability
- Burnout risk

### 4. Orientation (SEPA Cycle)

**Purpose**: Implements the core decision-making cycle
**SEPA Cycle**:
1. **Sense**: Gather current state and context
2. **Evaluate**: Assess situation and requirements
3. **Plan**: Generate and select action plans
4. **Act**: Execute or prepare for execution
5. **Learn**: Update knowledge and improve

### 5. UtilityEngine (Plan Scoring)

**Purpose**: Scores action plans using utility function
**Utility Formula**: `U = w_g*G + w_q*Q - w_r*R - w_s*S`

Where:
- G = Goal satisfaction
- Q = Quality
- R = Risk
- S = Spend (resource cost)
- w_* = Weights adjusted by maturity and personality

## Data Models

### Core Models

1. **ActionPlan**: Represents a decision execution plan
2. **DecisionTrace**: Audit trail for decisions
3. **MaturityProfile**: Developmental state
4. **MentalHealthMetrics**: Well-being indicators
5. **PersonalityInfluence**: Individual traits
6. **DecisionRequest/Response**: API interface

## Decision-Making Process

### 1. Request Validation
- Check maturity constraints (complexity, urgency)
- Validate mental health status
- Ensure system readiness

### 2. SEPA Cycle Execution
```
Request → Sense → Evaluate → Plan → Act → Learn → Response
```

### 3. Plan Generation and Selection
- Generate multiple candidate plans
- Score using utility function
- Apply personality adjustments
- Select best plan with fallbacks

### 4. Mental Health Integration
- Monitor decision impact on well-being
- Detect problematic patterns
- Provide intervention recommendations

## Personality Integration

### Personality Traits
- **Tone**: Communication style
- **Assertiveness**: Decision confidence
- **Patience**: Time tolerance
- **Humor**: Lightheartedness
- **Creativity**: Innovation preference
- **Analytical**: Logical thinking
- **Social**: Interaction preference

### Influence on Decision Making
Personality traits modify:
- Utility function weights
- Plan generation strategies
- Risk tolerance
- Communication style
- Learning preferences

## Mental Health Safeguards

### Detection Mechanisms
1. **Recursive Loop Detection**: Pattern analysis of thought cycles
2. **Addictive Behavior Monitoring**: Validation-seeking patterns
3. **Stress Assessment**: Decision complexity and urgency impact
4. **Emotional Stability Tracking**: Response volatility
5. **Burnout Prevention**: Workload and success rate monitoring

### Intervention Strategies
- **Recursive Loops**: Break circular patterns, increase supervision
- **Addictive Behavior**: Reduce validation-seeking, boost intrinsic motivation
- **High Stress**: Reduce complexity, increase planning time
- **Burnout Risk**: Workload reduction, stress management
